# QMD FILES TO LOAD: (in order)

1. EDA_Analysis.qmd -- data anslysis primarily on acled violecnce data and el-salvador specific data. Includes comparisons with wold bank datasets. Also includes natural language modeling, also includes mapping for shiny app

2.Economic_Analysis.qmd -- data analysis using world bank development indicators, as well as graphing development indicators vs violence from acled dataset. (also containes some code related to shapefiles used in shiny app)

3.EDA_Analysis.qmd -- data anslysis primarily on acled violecnce data and el-salvador specific data. Includes comparisons with wold bank datasets. Also includes natural language modeling, also includes mapping for shiny app
